# Cali-shop
This is the Capstone Project for the Microverse CSS and HTML curriculum. The objective of this project is to create a website using the design provided [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) with whatever content you desire. I chose to make a shop for calisthenics gear for fitness enthusiasts.
